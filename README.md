# MovieListFromAPI
 Loading data from api in tableView.
 Without using any pods.
 If I would use any pod in this project, I would surely go for kingfisher(Image cashing) and alamofire(For fetching data from api).




Running the project Guide - 
Kept it simple just clone project and open the "MovieList.xcodeproj" inside "MovieListFromAPI" folder with Xcode.
Thanks.
